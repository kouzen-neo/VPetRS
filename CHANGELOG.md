## [Unreleased]

## [v0.0.1] - 2026-10-26

### Added

- **Cargo Workspace Bootstrap**:
  - Initialized multi-crate Cargo workspace (`vpet-core`, `vpet-content`, `vpet-render`, `vpet-wayland`, `vpet-app`, `vpet-mods`, and excluded post-MVP `vpet-steam`) targeting Rust edition 2024.
  - Enforced strict crate dependency boundaries (`vpet-core` isolated from I/O, Wayland, and rendering; `vpet-app` as sole composition root).
  - Pinned stable toolchain (`rustfmt`, `clippy`) via `rust-toolchain.toml` and shared formatting rules via `.editorconfig`.
- **Zero-.NET Verification Gate**:
  - Added `scripts/check-no-dotnet.sh` to verify `vpet-rs` builds as a native ELF binary and fails if `cargo tree` or `ldd` references CoreCLR, Mono, or Avalonia.
- **Architecture & Phase Execution Plan**:
  - Added `IMPLEMENTATION.md` specifying the niri-first `wlr-layer-shell` design, `tiny-skia` + `wl_shm` rendering pipeline, LPS content compatibility, deterministic simulation, IPC, and AUR packaging.
  - Added `TODO.md` with Phase 0–9 task checklists, Gate 0 acceptance criteria, and conventional commit/tag map.
  - Added `AGENTS.md` and `README.md` documenting non-negotiable constraints, build gates, and KZKT-style changelog/commit rules.
